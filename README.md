GitHub User Search App

This is a small web application that allows users to search for a GitHub username and view the user's repositories. The app is built using React, TypeScript, and Material UI.

To run the app on your local machine, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install.
    Start the development server by running npm start.
    Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

To run the test suite, use the command npm test.(working on it...)

Future improvements for this project include:

    Improving the UI to provide a better user experience.
    Add an option to change the theme of the application, allowing users to customise their user experience.
    Deploying the app to a hosting platform.
    Add functionality to search by programming language.
    Adds user authentication with OAuth to allow users to connect to their GitHub accounts directly from the application.
    Create a list of favourites so that users can save their favourite repositories and return to them later.
    Add functionality to search and follow other GitHub users from within the application.

Overall, I enjoyed working on this project and learned a lot about React and Material UI. I look forward to continuing to improve upon this project in the future.
