GitHub User-Repositories Search App

This is a small web application that allows users to search for a GitHub username and view the user's repositories. The app is built using React, TypeScript, Material UI and Bootstrap. Everything has functionality, starting with the logo button that takes you back to the homepage, the "follow" button that redirects you to the user's profile on the official Github page, as well as the repositories. Finally, it should be noted that I have implemented several error controls in the user search and repository search.

To run the app on your local machine, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install.
    Start the development server by running npm start.
    Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

To run the test suite, use the command npm test.

Future improvements for this project include:

    Improving the UI to provide a better user experience.
    Add an option to change the theme of the application, allowing users to customise their user experience.
    Add functionality to search by programming language.
    Create a list of favourites so that users can save their favourite repositories and return to them later.
    Add functionality to search and follow other GitHub users from within the application.

Overall, I enjoyed working on this project and learned a lot about React and TypeScript. I look forward to continuing to improve upon this project in the future.
